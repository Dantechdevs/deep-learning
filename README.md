Interpretation
In this code, we create a simple autoencoder with a 10-dimensional input and a 2-dimensional bottleneck layer (latent space).
The autoencoder learns to compress the data into these 2 dimensions while minimizing the reconstruction error.
The scatter plot at the end shows the original data points (in red) and their corresponding encoded representations (in blue). You’ll notice that the encoded data captures essential patterns while reducing dimensionality.
Note: Remember, autoencoders are powerful tools for tasks like anomaly detection, denoising, and dimensionality reduction.
